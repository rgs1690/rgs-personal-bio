## About the Project
This is my personal bio site. Here I am showing off some of my favorite projects I have made so far in my Nashville Software School front-end development program. I also have some of my bakground information, technologies I use, and my contact information. 

## About the User
- When the user first comes to the site they are brought to a home page that deplays my name and a navigation bar. 
- The navigation can take the user to my About, Projects, Tech and Contact pages. 

## Features

- Users can view pages that display information about me, my projects, techonoliges I use, and my contact information.
- Each of my projects have buttons that will direct the user to the github repo and the deployed app of that project.
- The contact page has links that will direct the user to my linkedin and github profiles. 
- As an admin, I can login and I have private routes that will take me to a form where I can create new projects. I can also access an admin only project page that will allow me to delete and update projects.
- This site is responsive and mobile friendly.
