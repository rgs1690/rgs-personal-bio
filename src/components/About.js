                My name is Grace Sutherland, and I was born and raised in
                Nashville, Tennessee. I graduated from MTSU with a Bachelor of
                Fine Arts where I held a concentration in figurative oil
                painting. I supported myself through college and after by
                working in various bakeries in the Nashville area by baking and
                cake decorating. Cake decorating scratched that creative itch
                for me and I fully through myself into learning everything I
                could about it.

                Journey into software development

              <Accordion.Body>
                COVID-19 hit the food and service industries hard. These events
                lead me to explore more stable and fulfilling career options. I
                wanted a career that I could use my problem-solving abilities
                and creative drive. When I dove into trying to create my own
                website for a side cake business, I traveled down a rabbit hole
                of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tutorials and I from there I was
                hooked. I knew that I would benefit from guided instruction, so
                I signed up for the Nashville Software School’s introductory
                jumpstart program. After just a couple of weeks I knew I wanted
                to dedicate myself to making software development my new career.
                I then applied and was accepted into Nashville Software School’s
                part time, full stack, web development E16 cohort. I am almost
                halfway through the year long program, and I have learned so
                much and cannot wait continue my learning through out the rest
                of my career. I have found that background in art has helped
                develop my eye for detail that is needed for programming as well
                as design knowledge for front-end development. My experience in
                the service industry has also made me an excellent team member
                and empathize with the user of all my applications.
