                  My name is Grace Sutherland, and I was born and raised in
                  Nashville, Tennessee. I graduated from MTSU with a Bachelor of
                  Fine Arts where I held a concentration in figurative oil
                  painting. I supported myself through college and after by
                  baking and cake decorating in various bakeries in the
                  Nashville area.

                  COVID-19 hit the food and service industries hard. These
                  events lead me to explore more stable and fulfilling career
                  options. I wanted a career that I could use my problem-solving
                  abilities and creative drive. When I dove into trying to
                  create my own website for a side cake business, I traveled
                  down a rabbit hole of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tutorials and
                  from there I was hooked. I knew that I would benefit from
                  guided instruction, so I signed up for the Nashville Software
                  School’s introductory jumpstart program. After just a couple
                  of weeks I knew I wanted to dedicate myself to making software
                  development my new career. I then applied and was accepted
                  into Nashville Software School’s part time, full stack, web
                  development E16 cohort. I am almost halfway through the year
                  long program, and I have learned so much and cannot wait
                  continue my learning through out the rest of my career. I have
                  found that background in art has helped develop my eye for
                  detail that is needed for programming as well as design
                  knowledge for front-end development. My experience in the
                  service industry has also made me an excellent team member and
                  empathize with the user in all my applications.
